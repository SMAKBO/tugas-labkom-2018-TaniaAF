<h1>PRODUCTION OF FATTY ACID</h1>
<hr>
<p><b>Systematic engineering for free fatty acids production</b></p>
<p>We first started by establishing a platform strain that overproduces FFAs. In S. cerevisiae, fatty acids are mainly synthesized de novo by a cytosolic type I FAS  as activated fatty acids (fatty acyl-CoAs) by condensing acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. FFAs are rapidly re-activated by fatty acyl-CoA synthetases to fatty acyl-CoAs, whose accumulation feedback inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis. A wild-type strain therefore only produced 3 mg l−1 FFAs (Fig. 2a). To circumvent this, we interrupted the reactivation process by deleting two of the main fatty acyl-CoA synthetase encoding genes FAA1 and FAA4. To prevent fatty acid degradation through β-oxidation we also deleted POX1 encoding the fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, which catalyses the first step of this pathway. The resulting strain YJZ06 produced 0.56 g l−1 FFAs (Fig. 2a). This is consistent with earlier studies, which have shown that interruption of FFA activation is essential for FFA accumulation and secretion. Our previous and current studies (vide infra) showed that deletion of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-encoding gene HFD1 is essential for the production of fatty aldehyde-derived alkanes and fatty alcohols. Thus, we used the HFD1 knockout strain YJZ08 for further engineering. To further increase FFA production we expressed a truncated E. coli thioesterase encoding gene 'tesA (refs 5, 14) to increase FFA release from the FAS complex, which resulted in a titre of 0.67 g l−1 (strain YJZ13).</p>
<p><b>FFA production by engineered S. cerevisiae strains.</b></p>
<p>Next we aimed on increasing the supply of the precursor cytosolic acetyl-CoA by introducing a synthetic chimeric citrate lyase pathway (Fig. 1), which has been proposed to play an important role in lipid accumulation in oleaginous yeasts. In addition to expressing an ATP:citrate lyase (ACL) as described before, we here constructed and optimized the citrate lyase cycle (Figs 1 and and3a)3a) by systematically comparing different heterologous ACLs and malic enzymes (MEs), two significant components of this pathway, and overexpressing the endogenous mitochondrial citrate transporter Ctp1 and malate dehydrogenase 'Mdh3. Introduction of the chimeric acetyl-CoA pathway, consisting of ACL and ME from Rhodospuridium toruloides combined with overexpression of Ctp1 and 'Mdh3, improved the growth of a pyruvate decarboxylase negative strain IMI076 with an internal deletion in MTH1 (Pdc− MTH1-ΔT) (Fig. 3c). We further show that ACL from Mus musculus (MmACL) was better than the ones from R. toruloides (RtACL) and Homo sapiens (HsACL) in improving IMI076 growth (Fig. 3c) and ME from R. toruloides (RtME) was important for cell growth in addiction to ACL in IMI076 (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, the ACL-based acetyl-CoA pathway rescued the growth of pyruvate decarboxylase negative strain RWB837 (Fig. 3b), which is growth-deficient. Consistently, plasmid-overexpression of these genes improved FFA production (Fig. 3e) and MmACL was better for FFA production compared with RtACL and HsACL (Fig. 3f). Since plasmid-expression retarded the cell growth probably due to the metabolic burden (Supplementary Fig. 1), we thus genomic-integrated the optimized actyl-CoA pathway consisting of MmACL, RtME, CTP1 and ‘MDH3, which improved FFA production to 0.80 g l−1 (strain YJZ41, Fig. 2a).</p>
<p><b>Fatty acid from Palm oil</b></p>
<p>In Indonesia the main product from palm oil is frying oil. Palm oil producers usually sell their product in CPO form or in fresh fruit bunch form. CPO can be produced as oleo food and oleo chemical. One of the products of oleo chemical is fatty acid. Generally fatty acid is used for production of soap, detergent, lubricant, plasticizer, cosmetic and diesel fuel alternative. In Indonesia the production of fatty acid is relatively small because the process used to produces fatty acid is uneconomically. Besides, there is already a good market for frying oil produced from palm oil until now, fatty acids are produced by the hydrolysis of palm oil by using water at a temperature of 240°C - 260 °c and a pressure of 45 - 50 bar. Another way to produce fatty acid is the hydrolysis of palm oil by using enzyme, i.e. lipase. From an economical and technical point of view, both ways are in efficient because of the need of a CPO manufactures. To overcome this problem, an alternative cheaper process will be investigated. The alternative process that's being investigated is direct fatty acids production from palm fresh fruit bunches by activating the lipase enzyme in the palm fruit. Using this process, the degree of hydrolysis can reach about 56%. Dr. Ir. Robert Manurung, MEng </p>
