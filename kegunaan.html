<h1>THE BENEFITS OF FATTY ACIDS</h1>
<hr>
<img src="img/definisi.jpg" style="width: 30%">
<p>Fats (fatty acids) fall into two main groups – saturated and unsaturated – based on their chemistry. There are three major classes of unsaturated fatty acids: omega-3, omega-6 and omega-9. The omega-6s and omega-3s are essential. The omega-9s are non-essential because the body can make them from other fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids are further classified as either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. EFAs are polyunsaturated. They include:</p>
<p>1. The omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid (LA), and its derivatives, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid (AA)</p>
<p>2. The omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and its derivatives, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</p>
<p>Theoretically, only LA and ALA are absolutely essential. However, the fatty acids derived from them are also generally considered essential.</p>

<h2>EFAs in the treatment and prevention of disease</h2>
<img src="img/saturatedfattyacid.gif" style="width: 30%">
<p>SEFA deficiency has been identified in many diseases including mental disorders, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, eczema, PMS, immune dysfunction, and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. EFAs may help improve these conditions, and EFA supplementation has been studied in hundreds of clinical trials. Because of the often-impaired conversion of LA and ALA to their derivatives, much of the recent research on EFAs has focused on GLA, EPA and DHA, which are also absorbed and utilized more efficiently than LA and ALA.</p>
<h3>1. Heart disease</h3>
<p>Population studies have shown that a diet rich in ALA, EPA and DHA helps maintain a healthy heart and may protect against heart disease by reducing high blood lipids and blood pressure, and by decreasing blood clotting. Evidence supporting the benefits of EFAs for the the heart was so compelling that in October, 2000 the American Heart Association updated its dietary guidelines, recommending healthy adults consume at least two servings of fatty fish per week. At the same time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), finding the evidence suggestive, but not conclusive, allowed a qualified claim linking omega-3 fatty acids to a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. </p>

<h3>Unsaturated Fatty Acid</h3>
<img src="img/unsaturatedfattyacid.gif" style="width: 30%">
<p>Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds between carbon atoms. (Pairs of carbon atoms connected by double bonds can be saturated by adding hydrogen atoms to them, converting the double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the double bonds are called unsaturated.)</p>
