<h1>THE BENEFITS OF FATTY ACIDS</h1>
<hr>
<img src="img/definisi.jpg" style="width: 30%">
<p>Fats (fatty acids) fall into two main groups – saturated and unsaturated – based on their chemistry. There are three major classes of unsaturated fatty acids: omega-3, omega-6 and omega-9. The omega-6s and omega-3s are essential. The omega-9s are non-essential because the body can make them from other fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids are further classified as either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. EFAs are polyunsaturated. They include:</p>
<p>1. The omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid (LA), and its derivatives, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid (AA)</p>
<p>2. The omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and its derivatives, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</p>
<p>Theoretically, only LA and ALA are absolutely essential. However, the fatty acids derived from them are also generally considered essential.</p>

<p><b>EFAs in the treatment and prevention of disease</b></p>
<p>SEFA deficiency has been identified in many diseases including mental disorders, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, eczema, PMS, immune dysfunction, and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. EFAs may help improve these conditions, and EFA supplementation has been studied in hundreds of clinical trials. Because of the often-impaired conversion of LA and ALA to their derivatives, much of the recent research on EFAs has focused on GLA, EPA and DHA, which are also absorbed and utilized more efficiently than LA and ALA.</p>

<p><b>1. Heart disease</b></p>
<p>Population studies have shown that a diet rich in ALA, EPA and DHA helps maintain a healthy heart and may protect against heart disease by reducing high blood lipids and blood pressure, and by decreasing blood clotting. Evidence supporting the benefits of EFAs for the the heart was so compelling that in October, 2000 the American Heart Association updated its dietary guidelines, recommending healthy adults consume at least two servings of fatty fish per week. At the same time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), finding the evidence suggestive, but not conclusive, allowed a qualified claim linking omega-3 fatty acids to a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. </p>
<p><b>2. Arthritis and other joint conditions</b></p>
<p>GLA is converted to eicosanoids with potent anti-inflammatory properties. It also modulates the immune response, which can decrease joint inflammation and destruction. Many rheumatoid arthritis sufferers are deficient in GLA, and respond favorably to GLA treatment. Placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that supplementation with GLA may reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in both children and adults. Reductions in the duration of morning stiffness, joint swelling, tenderness and pain have been noted. Supplementation with GLA also reduced the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and corticosteroids in many cases.</p>
<p><b>3. Skin disorders</b></p>
<p>Deficiencies of EFAs, most notably GLA, have been related to eczema and other skin disorders. EFAs help alleviate dry, itchy, and inflamed skin and help reduce moisture loss. Although various EFAs and skin disorders have been examined, by far the most studied is the use of GLA for eczema. At least 22 randomized, placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, with the majority showing significant benefit. In several studies, patients taking GLA were able to reduce the use of drugs such as antibiotics, oral steroids and topical steroids.</p>
<p><b>4. Mental disorders</b></p>
<p>Although omega-3 EFAs are best known for their heart-protecting benefits, they may also play a role in mental health. Many disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s, dementia, cognitive impairment, and behavioral and learning disorders (such as dyslexia and attention deficit disorder), have been linked to EFA deficiency. Recent research demonstrates that EPA and DHA may be useful in treating depression and other mental disorders.</p>
<p><b>5. Other health conditions</b></p>
<p>Research using EFAs is underway in many other areas, including gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, obesity, PMS, mastalgia (breast tenderness), hypertension, multiple sclerosis, lupus, asthma, allergies and cancer. Recent human clinical trials done in the area of cancer, although preliminary in nature, are encouraging. GLA has demonstrated anticancer effects, both alone and in combination with drug therapy, such as tamoxifen. Other areas of research include supplementation during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and for infants and young children.</p>
<p><b>Suggested EFA Requirements</b></p>
<p>Because the typical North American diet is substantially different from the diet of our ancestors (more trans and saturated fats, less EFA-containing seeds, berries and fish) and because so many other factors interfere with fatty acid metabolism, most diets may not contain sufficient EFAs. Unfortunately, the exact requirements for individual EFAs are not clearly defined, despite the large volume of literature available on the subject.</p>
<p>In 1999, an international working group of scientists met at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland to discuss dietary recommendations for EFAs. Although they concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to establish Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), there was enough data to establish Adequate Intake (AI) recommendations for adults. Based on a daily 2000 kcal diet, their recommended daily AI was defined as 4.44 grams of LA; 2.22 grams of ALA; and 0.65 grams of DHA/EPA combined. The working group also recognized that there is too much trans fat in the food supply, and recommended an upper limit of 2 grams per day</p>
<p><b>Side effects of EFA supplementation</b></p>
<p>EFAs can be consumed in large amounts (as much as 50 grams per day) with no serious side effects. Occasional minor side effects may include stomach upset, burping, flatulence, soft stools and diarrhea. These side effects often lessen with continued use and occur more often at higher doses. To minimize side effects, consume with food, start with smaller doses, and increase the dose gradually over several weeks. Persons on anticoagulant or blood thinning medications should consult a health care practitioner before taking EFA supplements from fish since they can thin the blood.
While more research is needed on the role of EFAs in specific diseases, it is clear most individuals can benefit from EFA supplementation to maintain optimal health and nutrition. There is also strong evidence that EFAs can help prevent or treat specific health conditions. Furthermore, they are safe and well tolerated, and readily available wherever health supplements are sold. Consult your health care practitioner or the resource guide in this booklet for more information.
